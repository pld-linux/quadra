---------------------
[2-1] What is Quadra?
---------------------

Quadra is a great puzzle game by. Quadra is like Tetris but features
 a kind of "gravity" so loose blocks fall down until they get stuck.
This enables you to clear massive amouts of lines at once, infact if
you built up the blocks correctly, you could use 1 piece to take out
15 or even more lines! Quadra is a fast, fun and very addictive game
which comes with full internet support! You can download Quadra for a
totally free 1 month trial from. And after you try it for a whole
month you can register your version for just $10, what a bargain!

Internet game supports 8 players and many watching players, as well
as up to 3 players per computer.
A very cheap price tag of just $10  =)

single player and multiplayer games.

Fully customisable multiplayer modes with teams and different winning 
conditions.
Fully customisable controls with rotate left AND rotate right

And it also features really fast levels that'll have those blocks 
flying down on you and driving you crazy!

--------------
[2-2] Controls
--------------

The default controls are as follows:

Left arrow			Move block peice left
Right arrow			Move block peice right
Down arrow			Force block peice down
Ctrl button			Rotate block left
Alt button			Rotate block right

----------------
[2-3] The Pieces
----------------

The blocks are formed from the 7 different ways of arranging 4
squares together:
 __
|__|
|__| The Straigt piece. Green in color.
|__|
|__|

 __
|__|
|__|__   The 'L' piece. Purple in color.
|__|__|

    __
   |__|
 __|__|  The 'J' piece. Yellow in color.
|__|__|

 __ __ __
|__|__|__| The 'T' piece. Blue in color.
   |__|

    __ __
 __|__|__| The 'S' piece. Cyan in color.
|__|__|

 __ __
|__|__|__  The 'Z' piece. Red in color.
   |__|__|

 __ __
|__|__|  The Square piece. Orange in color.
|__|__|


---------------------------------
[2-4] What to do with the pieces.
---------------------------------

Each piece will fall from the top of the screen into a section
sometimes called the 'well' or build area. Here as the peice falls
down you can move it into varios positions and spin it around. Once
the peice hits the bottom is gets stuck.

-------------------------
[3-1] The aim of the game
-------------------------

The aim of the game is to achieve the most points. The number of
points given out depends on a number of factors including:
1)number of lines cleared with your last block
2)how many recursions were needed until everything settled into place
3)level number you have reached


How do you clear lines you ask? Well assume a setup like below
consisting of 4 straight peices:
        
#                               #
#                               #
# __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __       #
#|__ __ __ __|__ __ __ __|__    #
#   |__ __ __ __|__ __ __ __|   #
#################################

Now the player drops a J piece into the positions shown:

#                            __ #
#                           |  |#
# __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __|  |#
#|__ __ __ __|__ __ __ __|__ __|#
#   |__ __ __ __|__ __ __ __|   #
#################################

This will cause the whole 2nd line to vanish:

#                            __ #
#                           |  |#
#                           |__|#
#    __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __    #
#   |__ __ __ __|__ __ __ __|   #
#################################


The rest of the J block will now fall down:

#                               #
#                               #
#                            __ #
#    __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __|  |#
#   |__ __ __ __|__ __ __ __|__|#
#################################

See how the rest of the J blocked fell down 2 rows? That is because
it was free to do so. In Tetris the remaining section of the J block
would have only fell down 1 row.


---------------------------
[3-2] How the scoring works
---------------------------

Here is the coding from the game itself (thanks to Dada for sending
me it!) :

switch(depth) {
    case 0: return;    case 1: score_add = 250; break;
    case 2: score_add = 500; break;    case 3: score_add = 1000; 
break;
    case 4: score_add = 2000; break;
    default: score_add = 200 * depth * depth; break;  }
  score_add += 1000*(complexity-1);  score_add += (score_add/10)*level;
  stats[SCORE].add(score_add);
where depth =(number of lines cleared with your last block)
complexity =(how many recursions were needed until everything 
settled into place)
level =(level number you have reached) (note that Quadra always give 
bonus points for the level, even at level 1 so you will never see 
250 points for a single, the minimum is 275)

So if you can follow that good! If not here is a list of scores for
level 1 going up to a depth of 10 with all different complexity
levels:


SCORE		DEPTH		LEVEL		COMPLEXITY		
275		1		1		1

-------------------------------------------------
[3-3] Eh? How do you clear so many lines at once?
-------------------------------------------------

The best why to learn how to play single player games well is to
watch the world top score replays. See the replay section for how 
to do this. But I will dmonstrate how to clear 11 lines at once:


You could build up the blocks like so:

# __                            #
#|  |                           #
#|  |                           #
#|  |                           #
#|__|                           #
#|  |                           #
#|  |                           #
#|  |                           #
#|__|                           #
#|  |                           #
#|  |__ __ __ __ __ __ __       #

#   |                          |#
#   |                          |#
#   |                          |#
#   |     (lots of blocks      |#
#   |     arranged in this     |#
#   |     section)             |#
#   |                          |#
#   |__ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __|#

Now a Square peice is added which completes a line.

# __                            #
#|  |                           #

#   |     (lots of blocks      |#

#   |     section)             |#
#   |                          |#
#   |__ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __|#
#################################


The line is cleared and the stacked straigt pieces fall into the
'Hole'

#    __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ #
# __|                          |#

#|  |                          |#
#|__|__ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __|#
#################################

Now another 10 lines are completed, making a total of 11 lines
completed by droping just 1 peice in! This leaves:

#    __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ #
#   |__ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __|#
#################################

Doing this kind of move is usually called a 'Build up' as you build
up all the blocks then remove heaps of 'em at once.

---------------------------------------------
[3-4] How do you get really good high scores?
---------------------------------------------

As a beginner you should try to do build ups on the early levels, and
then concentrate on staying alive once you get to the higher levels.
But once you get more experienced you should find that you will be
able to do big build ups on higher levels where the blocks fall
faster. Learning how to use the left rotate and the right rotate
buttons is also very important and will help you place the blocks in
the right positions on the faster levels.

-------------------------------------
[4-1] The different Multiplayer Games
-------------------------------------

There are 3 different multiplayer games which you can play.
1 - Local Game (no network) - All players are using just your 1 
	computer allowing a maxiumum of 3 players.
2 - TCP/IP Local Network (lan) - This is for multiplayer games over
	networked computers which are using TCP/IP
3 - TCP/IP Internet - This is for playing internet games against 
	people from all over the world!

--------------------------------
[4-2] How multiplayer games work
--------------------------------

In multiplayer games players join 1 of 7 different teams. The teams
are:
Red, Blue, Green, Cyan, Orange, Yellow and Purple.

When a member of a team clears multiple lines at once lets say 4 
lines, then 3 lines are 'dumped' onto all of the players in all of
the other teams. 'Dumped' lines are lines which are missing one
piece and they stack up from the bottom of the other players screens.
Some times the host of the multiplayer game sets what is called a
smallest offensive line combo. This is a preset number set by the
host of the multiplayer such that you can only send lines if you
equal of exceed that number. For example if it is set to 5, then the
minamum number of lines you can dump on your opponent is 4 by
clearing 5 lines.

When you dump (or send as it is also called) lines on other players,
sometimes you will get a frag when the other player dies. Getting
a frag is a good thing, being fragged is not. See section 4-8 for
more information about frags.

-------------------------
[4-3] Create Game options
-------------------------

When you create a new multiplayer game you can pick a number of 
options. These are:

Game Type:
	Free for All
		- Frag your opponents and respawn when you die.
	Survivor Mode
		- The last team alive wins them everybody respawn.

Level Up:
	After 15 lines
		- Players will goto the next level after every 15 lines
		  that they clear.
	Disabled
		- No possible way to change the level.

Start game at level:
	Start on which even level you want (1 to 9 only), starting on
	level 9 can be fun =)

Smallest Offensive Line Combo:
	Smallest amount of lines players can send.

The game ends when:
	Frags 
		- Game ends when any player reaches the set amount of
		  frags.
	Time
		- Game ends after the set amount of time.
	Never
		- Never ending game (most internet game are like this)

Record game:
	Allows you to record the multiplayer game to a .rec file.
	See the recording section for more info.
	Note: You can NOT record local player no network games.

----------------------------------------
[4-4] The user interface and its options
----------------------------------------

At first you may find the user interface a bit wierd. But actually
its really good. Just aviod pressing esc when you make the wrong
selection as this exits the whole multiplayer game, instead click on
the 'close' button. The interface is made up of 3 windows.
Each window has these options available:

Start &lt;player name&gt; - Start playing with this player setup
Start &lt;player name 2&gt; - Start playing with this player setup 
Start &lt;player name 3&gt; - Start playing with this player setup

Show Players - This show a list of all the current players in the
	game. You can click on a player and choose view player to
	watch them play. You can watch up to 4 people in a single
	window.
Block Info - Displays the block info for 2 players at a time. Click
	on the players names to change from player to player.
Lines Info - Same as block info but shows lines information.
Select Scheme - Allows you to select which scheme you want to play
	in (the background wallpaper and sounds) 
Chat Window - This is where you chat to the othe players.

Network Tools - This is an extra option which only appears for the
	host (the creator) of the game. It allows the host to drop
	players and connections. You can also set if you want to allow
	players and connections to join and you can test the pings to
	the players here as well. You can also view some IP info.

-------------------------------
[4-5] Pausing Multiplayer Games
-------------------------------

Pausing is done with the 'Pause/Break' key usually found at the top
right of your keyboard.
Any player can pause a multiplayer game. The only players able to
unpause the game are the player the paused the game and the host.

---------------------------------
[4-6] Multiplayer Game Recordings
---------------------------------

Only the host can record a multiplayer game. So if you are joining
the multiplayer game, you can not record it.

Also, you can not record local no network games. Only TCP/IP LAN and
internet game can be recorded.

See the Demo Central section for information on replaying multiplayer
recordings.

----------------------
[4-7] Multiplayer Tips
----------------------

Multiplayer games are all about being fast, very fast. To be real
good at multiplayer game practice playing really fast and try and
send lines when ever you can. If there are more than 3 or 4 players
in the game, you should not try a big build up (unless your sure you
can pull it off) because you will get lines dumped on you making you
no longer able to pull of the build up. Another tip is when you have
a build up, dont use it until another player is nearly dead, as when
you send the lines you will kill the other player and get a frag for
it.

-------------------------------
[4-8] Frag - How is it defined?
-------------------------------

I could not fiqure it out myself how a frag worked, but Dada was kind
enough to give me some info about how Quadra defines a frag:

For every line you send to somebody (let's call him Bob), 2 attack
points are counted. Those attack points are cumulative so if you send
3 lines (6 points) and a little while after you send another 4 lines
(8 points), Bob has 14 attack points coming from you. Keeping the 
same example, lets suppose a 3rd player called John is also in the 
game and he sends 5 lines. Then the current attack points will be:

You: 10 points from John
	0 points from Bob

Bob: 14 points from you
     10 points from John

John: 14 points from you
	 0 point from bob

Now lets assume that Bob now dies. You will get a frag because you
are the one who has accumulated the most attack points against Bob.

Now heres the key point: every time anybody places a block, the
attack points they received from all their enemies are decreased by
one. So in the same example, if John manages to place 14 blocks 
before dying, you will not get a frag (assuming you don't send any 
more lines in that time). On the other hand, if you manage to place
9 blocks correctly but you die before placing the 10th one after 
Johns 5-lines attack, John will get a frag against you.

So the rule is quite simple: every line sent adds 2 attack points to
everybody receiving the line and every block placed reduces by one 
the attack points accumulated by the opponents. If you die with all 
the attack points down to zero, nobody gets the frag. If you die with 
one or more attack points accumulated against you, the attacker with 
the most attack points against you will get the frag.

Survivor mode works a little bit differently: the program will never
"forget" an attack, even if you place a million blocks. That's why 
you (almost) always get a frag in survivor mode.

Here you can replay recorded demos. Demo or recordings as they are
also known, have the .rec exstension and a very small files
considering all the information they contain. The 'Quadra Players'
web site (http://www.quadraplayer.cjb.net) is always wanting your
.rec files so get there and send them in. You can also download .rec
file from that site as well.

To replay a .rec file just select it in the left pain of the Demo
Central screen. Depending on what version it was recorded with the
information should come up in the left section. Now click start
play back and sit back and watch.

If your watching a multiplayer game be sure, once the replaying
starts, open up the watch players window or nothing will seem to
happen.

Also note that for multiplayer games pauses are recorded so at the
start of the recording there is usually no action for a period of
time, especially for internet games.

The following tips were sent in by the Quadra Master himself - Mutt.
He currently holds the highest ever score of 545897!!!

5. Practice on High speeds. You can do this by creating a multiplayer
game and makeing the game start at a higher level.

4. Build up! Build up for 9 liners, once you get better build up for 
13 liners!! 

3. Think and look ahead. Use the gravity feature when ever you can.
Remember that clearing 2 cascading lines using gravity is werth more
than clearing a 2 lines that doesn't casscade. 

2. Learn to build up on the high speeds. It is very scary to do, but
 it gives you a whole heap of points. Learn to get 5+ liners on 
levels 10 and above. 

1. (The most important) USE BOTH ROTATE BUTTONS!!!!! There is no way
that on level 14 you will be able to hit the rotate button 3 times.
It is necessary that you us both. I recommend the 3 bottom arrow 
keys for guidance and "d" and "s" for rotate buttons. 


(These tips were sent in by Mutt and were slighly edited)
